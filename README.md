# The Lost Trinket
A text adventure game made by my friend and me in school
The game is written in python and it is basically just a hit and run game. 
We finished the base of the game in one day.
The plot is a human called Bob fights many monsters to retrieve a powerful trinket.
The trinket is obtained by killed a final boss.
